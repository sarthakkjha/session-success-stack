# 🎯 Paytension – Bet on Your Focus, Earn or Give

Welcome to **Paytension**, a productivity and accountability platform designed to help users stay focused, achieve their goals, and contribute to meaningful causes—all in one session.

## 🌟 What is Paytension?

FocusFi is a web application where users **stake money** on their ability to **stay focused** during a self-defined work session. If they succeed, they get their money back. If they fail (due to distractions or early exit), their stake is donated to charity.

This app is built for a hackathon using a fixed tech stack: **Base**, **ScreenPipe**, and **Grok AI**.

## 🧠 Why Paytension?

In today’s digital world, staying focused is harder than ever. Paytension helps:
- Boost productivity by introducing financial accountability.
- Reduce distractions by tracking app usage in real time.
- Support charitable causes even in failure.
- Empower users with AI assistance through Grok AI.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Login & Wallet Connection**
   - Users sign in and connect their crypto wallet using the **Base** platform.

2. **Set Up a Focus Session**
   - Choose the amount of time to focus.
   - Decide how much money to stake.
   - Select apps to whitelist (allowed) or blacklist (not allowed) using ScreenPipe.

3. **Start Session**
   - FocusFi monitors real-time activity.
   - If a user uses unapproved apps or exits early, they get up to 5 warnings.
   - Crossing the limit or quitting early results in session failure.

4. **During the Session**
   - Users get access to an AI assistant powered by **Grok AI** to help with tasks and queries.

5. **End of Session**
   - Success: Get back the staked money.
   - Failure: Stake is donated to a charity.
