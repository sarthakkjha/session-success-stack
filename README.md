# 🎯 Cointention – Transform your productivity with purpose

Welcome to **Cointention**, a productivity and accountability platform designed to help users stay focused, achieve their goals, and contribute to meaningful causes—all in one session.

## 🌟 What is Cointention?

Cointention is a desktop application where users **stake money** on their ability to **stay focused** during a self-defined work session. If they succeed, they get their money back. If they fail (due to distractions or early exit), their stake is used to fund education of under-privileged kids in rural India.

## 🧠 Why Cointention?

In today’s digital world, staying focused is harder than ever. Paytension helps:
- Boost productivity by introducing financial accountability.
- Reduce distractions by tracking app usage in real time.
- Support charitable causes even in failure.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Login & Wallet Connection**
   - Users sign in and connect their crypto wallet using the **Base** platform.

2. **Set Up a Focus Session**
   - Choose the amount of time to focus.
   - Decide how much money to stake.
   - Select apps to whitelist (allowed) or blacklist (not allowed) using ScreenPipe.

3. **Start Session**
   - Screenpipe monitors real-time activity.
   - If a user uses unapproved apps or exits early, they get up to 5 warnings.
   - Crossing the limit or quitting early results in session failure.

4. **During the Session**
   - Users get access to an AI assistant powered by **Groq AI** to help with tasks and queries.

5. **End of Session**
   - Success: Get back the staked money.
   - Failure: Stake is donated to a charity.
